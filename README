pg_rman
=======

pg_rman is a backup and recovery manager for PostgreSQL servers able to do
incremental, archive and full backup as well as restore a cluster to a
state defined by a given recovery target. It is designed to perform
periodic backups of an existing PostgreSQL server, combined with WAL
archives to provide a way to recover a server in case of failure of
server because of a reason or another. Its incremental and archive backup
facilities reduces the amount of data necessary to be taken between
two consecutive backups.

Download
--------

The latest version of this software can be found on the project website at
https://github.com/michaelpq/pg_rman.

Installation
------------

Compiling pg_rman requires a PostgreSQL installation and can be done in
two ways:

1. Put pg_rman project directory inside PostgreSQL source tree as
contrib/pg_rman, and use this command for compilation:

	$ cd $POSTGRES_SOURCE/contrib/pg_rman
	$ make

2. Keep the project directory as-is and use the PGXS development
infrastructure provided by a PostgreSQL installation to perform the
compilation:

	$ make USE_PGXS=1

In addition, you must have pg_config in $PATH.

The current version of pg_rman is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.3 and
upper versions.

Platforms
---------

pg_rman has been tested on Linux and Unix-based platforms.

Documentation
-------------

All the documentation is maintained in doc/ as text file, that is then
fetched by asciidoc to generate automatically man pages and html
documentation.

In order to generate the documentation, the variables XMLTO and ASCIIDOC
need to be set to proper values indicating where are located the binaries
of respectively xmlto and asciidoc. An example of build is as follows:

	$ make USE_PGXS=1 ASCIIDOC=asciidoc XMLTO=xmlto

They could as well be set as environment variables for development
purposes.

Regression tests
----------------

The test suite of pg_rman is available in the code tree and can be
launched in a way similar to common PostgreSQL extensions and modules:

1) "make check" or "make installcheck" if the project directory is
located in PostgreSQL code tree.

2) "make installcheck" on an already installed server if project
directory is kept as-is.
