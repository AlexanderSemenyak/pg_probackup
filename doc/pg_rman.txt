== NAME ==

pg_rman - Backup and recovery manager for PostgreSQL

== SYNOPSIS ==

pg_rman [ OPTIONS ]
    { init |
      backup |
      restore |
      show [ DATE | timeline ] |
      validate [ DATE ] |
      delete DATE }

DATE is the start time of the target backup in ISO-format:
(YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS). Prefix match is used to compare DATE and backup
files.

== DESCRIPTION ==

pg_rman is a utility program to backup and restore PostgreSQL database.
It takes a physical online backup of whole database cluster, archive
WALs, and server logs.

It proposes the following features:
- Backup while database runs including tablespaces with just one
  command
- Recovery from backup with just one command, with customized targets
  to facilitate the use of PITR.
- Support for full, incremental and archive backup
- Compression of backup files
- Management of backups with integrated catalog

== COMMANDS ==

pg_rman supports the following commands. See also Options for details of
OPTIONS.

init::
    Initialize a backup catalog.

backup::
    Take an online backup.

restore::
    Perform restore.

show::
    Show backup history. The timeline option shows timeline of the backup
    and the parent's timeline for each backup. 

validate::
    Validate backup files.

delete::
    Delete backup files.

=== INITIALIZATION ===

First, you need to create "a backup catalog" to store backup files and
their metadata. It is recommended to setup archive_mode and archive_command
in postgresql.conf before initializing the backup catalog. If the variables
are initialized, pg_rman can adjust the config file to the setting. In this
case, you have to specify the database cluster path for PostgreSQL. Please
specify it in PGDATA environmental variable or -D/--pgdata option.

	$ pg_rman init -B <a backup catalog path>

=== BACKUP ===

Backup target can be one of the following types also serverlogs can be added):

- Full backup, backup a whole database cluster. 

- Incremental backup, backup only files or pages modified after the last
verified backup. 

- Archive WAL backup, Backup only archive WAL files.

It is recommended to verify backup files as soon as possible after backup.
Unverified backup cannot be used in restore and in incremental backup. 

=== RESTORE ===

PostgreSQL server should be stopped before performing a restore. If database
cluster still exists, restore command will save unarchived transaction log
and delete all database files. You can retry recovery until a new backup is
taken. After restoring files, pg_rman creates recovery.conf in $PGDATA. The
conf file contains parameters for recovery. It is as well possible to modify
the file manually.

It is recommended to take a full backup as soon as possible after recovery
has succeeded.

If "--recovery-target-timeline" is not specifed, the last checkpoint's
TimeLineID in control file ($PGDATA/global/pg_control) will be the restore
target. If pg_control is not present, TimeLineID in the full backup used by
the restore will be a restore target. 


== Examples ==

To reduce the number of command line arguments, you can set BACKUP_PATH,
an environment variable, to the absolute path of the backup catalog and
write default configuration into ${BACKUP_PATH}/pg_rman.ini.

	$ cat $BACKUP_PATH/pg_rman.ini
	ARCLOG_PATH = /home/postgres/arclog
	SRVLOG_PATH = /home/postgres/pgdata/pg_log
	BACKUP_MODE = F
	COMPRESS_DATA = YES
	KEEP_ARCLOG_FILES = 10
	KEEP_ARCLOG_DAYS = 10
	KEEP_DATA_GENERATIONS = 3
	KEEP_DATA_DAYS = 120
	KEEP_SRVLOG_FILES = 10
	KEEP_SRVLOG_DAYS = 10

=== TAKE A BACKUP ===

This example takes a full backup of the whole database with server logs.
Then, it validates all unvalidated backups.
	$ pg_rman backup --backup-mode=full --with-serverlog
	$ pg_rman validate

=== RESTORE FROM A BACKUP ===

Here are some commands to restore from a backup:
	$ pg_ctl stop -m immediate
	$ pg_rman restore
	$ pg_ctl start

=== SHOW A BACKUP ===

	$ pg_rman show
	==================================================================================================
	Start                Mode  Current TLI  Parent TLI  Time    Data     WAL     Log  Backup   Status  
	==================================================================================================
	2013-12-25 03:02:31  INCR            1           0    0m   203kB    67MB    ----    67MB   DONE
	2013-12-25 03:02:31  INCR            1           0    0m      0B    ----    ----      0B   ERROR
	2013-12-25 03:02:25  FULL            1           0    0m    33MB    33MB    ----    64MB   OK

The fields are:
- Start : start time of backup
- Mode: Mode of backup
-- FULL for a full backup
-- INCR for an incremental backup
-- ARCH for archive backup
- Current TLI: current timeline of backup
- Parent TLI: parent timeline of backup
- Time : total time necessary to take this backup
- Total : Total size of backup
- Data : size of data files
- WAL : size of read WAL archive files
- Log : size of read server log files
- Backup: size of backup (= written size)
- Status: status of backup. Possible values are:
-- OK : backup is done and validated.
-- DONE : backup is done, but not validated yet.
-- RUNNING : backup is running
-- DELETING : backup is being deleted.
-- DELETED : backup has been deleted.
-- ERROR : backup is unavailable because some errors occur during backup.
-- CORRUPT : backup is unavailable because it is broken.

When a date is specified, more details about a backup is retrieved:

	$ pg_rman show '2011-11-27 19:15:45'
	# configuration
	BACKUP_MODE=FULL
	WITH_SERVERLOG=false
	COMPRESS_DATA=false
	# result
	TIMELINEID=1
	START_LSN=0/08000020
	STOP_LSN=0/080000a0
	START_TIME='2011-11-27 19:15:45'
	END_TIME='2011-11-27 19:19:02'
	RECOVERY_XID=1759
	RECOVERY_TIME='2011-11-27 19:15:53'
	DATA_BYTES=25420184
	ARCLOG_BYTES=32218912
	BACKUP_BYTES=242919520
	BLOCK_SIZE=8192
	XLOG_BLOCK_SIZE=8192
	STATUS=OK

You can check the "RECOVERY_XID" and "RECOVERY_TIME" which are used for
restore option "--recovery-target-xid", "--recovery-target-time".

The delete command deletes backup files not required by recovery after
the specified date.

== OPTIONS ==

pg_rman accepts the following command line parameters. Some of them can
be also sepcified as environment variables. See also Parameters for the
details.

=== COMMON OPTIONS ===
As a general rule, paths for data location need to be specified as
absolute paths; relative paths are not allowed.

-D PATH / --pgdata=PATH::
    The absolute path of database cluster. Required on backup and
    restore.

-A PATH / --arclog-path=PATH::
    The absolute path of archive WAL directory. Required on backup
    and restore. 

-S PATH / --srvlog-path=PATH::
    The absolute path of server log directory. Required on backup with
    server logs and restore. 

-B PATH / --backup-path=PATH::
    The absolute path of backup catalog. This option is mandatory.

-c / --check::
    If specifed, pg_rman doesn't perform actual jobs but only checks
    parameters and required resources. The option is typically used with
    --verbose option to verify the operation. 

-v / --verbose::
    If specified, pg_rman works in verbose mode.

=== BACKUP OPTIONS ===

-b { full | incremental | archive } --backup-mode={ full | incremental | archive }::
    Specify backup target files. Available options are: "full" backup,
    "incremental" backup, and "archive" backup. Abbreviated forms
    (prefix match) are also available. For example, -b f means "full"
    backup. 

    full : Whole database backup and archive backup
    incremental : Incremental backup and archive backup
    archive : Only archive backup 

-s / --with-serverlog::
    Backup server log files if specified. 

-Z / --compress-data::
    Compress backup files with zlib if specified. 

-C / --smooth-checkpoint::
    Checkpoint is performed on every backups. If the option is specified,
    do smooth checkpoint then. See also the second argument for
    pg_start_backup(). 

--keep-data-generations / --keep-data-days::
    Specify how long backuped data files will be kept.
    --keep-data-generations means number of backup generations.
    --keep-data-days means days to be kept.
    Only files exceeded one of those settings are deleted.

--keep-arclog-files / --keep-arclog-days::
    Specify how long backuped archive WAL files will be kept.
    --keep-arclog-files means number of backup files.
    --keep-arclog-days means days to be kept. When backup is run, only
    files exceeded one of those settings are deleted from archive storage.

--keep-srvlog-files / --keep-srvlog-days::
    Specify how long backuped serverlog files will be kept.
    --keep-srvlog-files means number of backup files.
    --keep-srvlog-days means days to be kept.
    When backup is run, only files exceeded one of those settings are
    deleted from server log directory (log_directory). This option works
    when you specify --with-serverlog and --srvlog-path options in backup
    command.

=== RESTORE OPTIONS ===

The parameters whose name start are started with --recovery refer to
the same parameters as the ones in recovery.confin recovery.conf.

--recovery-target-timeline TIMELINE::
    Specifies recovering into a particular timeline. 
    If not specified, the current timeline is used.

--recovery-target-time TIMESTAMP::
    This parameter specifies the timestamp up to which recovery will
    proceed.

--recovery-target-xid XID::
    This parameter specifies the transaction ID up to which recovery
    will proceed. 

--recovery-target-inclusive::
    Specifies whether server pauses when recovery target is reached.

--hard-copy::
    Archived WAL files are copied to archive WAL storage area. If you
    do not specify --hard-copy, pg_rman makes symlink to archive WAL
    where are in the backup catalog directory.

=== CATALOG OPTIONS ===

-a / --show-all::
    Show all existing backups, including the deleted ones.

=== CONNECTION OPTIONS ===
Parameters to connect PostgreSQL server.

-d DBNAME / --dbname=DBNAME::
    The database name to execute pg_start_backup() and pg_stop_backup().

-h HOSTNAME / --host=HOSTNAME::
    Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is running.
    If the value begins with a slash, it is used as the directory for the
    Unix domain socket.

-p PORT / --port=PORT::
    Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file extension on
    which the server is listening for connections.

-U USERNAME / --username=USERNAME::
    User name to connect as. 

-w / --no-password::
    Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires password
    authentication and a password is not available by other means such as
    a .pgpass file, the connection attempt will fail. This option can be
    useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a
    password. 

-W / --password::
    Force pg_rman to prompt for a password before connecting to a database.
    This option is never essential, since pg_rman will automatically
    prompt for a password if the server demands password authentication.
    However, pg_rman will waste a connection attempt in order to find out
    if the server wants a password. In some cases it is worth typing -W
    to avoid the extra connection attempt. 

=== GLOBAL OPTIONS ===

--help::
    Print help, then exit.

-V / --version::
    Print version information, then exit.

-! / --debug::
    Show debug information.

== PARAMETERS ==

Some of parameters can be specified as command line arguments, environment
variables or in configuration file as follows:

		--hard-copy		HARD_COPY		Yes

Variable names in configuration file are the same as long names or names
of environment variables. The password can not be specified in command
line and configuration file for security reason. 

This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, also uses the
environment variables supported by libpq (see Environment Variables) 

== RESTRICTIONS ==

pg_rman has the following restrictions.

- Requires to read database cluster directory and write backup catalog
  directory. It is usually necessary to mount the disk where backup
  catalog is placed with NFS or related from database server.
- Major versions of pg_rman and server should match.
- Block sizes of pg_rman and server should match.
- If there are some unreadable files/directories in data folder of server
  WAL directory or archived WAL directory, the backup or restore will fail
  depending on the backup mode selected.
- Incremental backup is not able to take necessary files after a database
  creation, so take a full backup once a new database is created.

== DETAILS ==

=== RECOVERY TO POINT-IN-TIME ===
pg_rman can recover to point-in-time if timeline, transaction ID, or
timestamp is specified in recovery.conf. xlogdump is a contrib module of
PostgreSQL core that allows checking in the content of WAL files and
determine when to recover. This might help.

=== CONFIGURATION FILE ===
Setting parameters in configuration file is done as "name=value". Quotes
are required if the value contains whitespaces. Comments should start with
"#" and are automatically ignored. Whitespaces and tabs are ignored
excluding values.

=== EXIT CODE ===
pg_rman returns exit codes for each error status.

	Code	Name			Description
	0	SUCCESS			Operation succeeded.
	1	HELP			Print help, then exit
	2	ERROR			Generic error
	3	FATAL			Exit because of repeated errors
	4	PANIC			Unknown critical condition
	10	ERROR_SYSTEM		I/O or system error
	11	ERROR_NOMEM		Out of memory
	12	ERROR_ARGS		Invalid input parameters
	13	ERROR_INTERRUPTED	Interrupted by user (Ctrl+C etc.)
	14	ERROR_PG_COMMAND	SQL error
	15	ERROR_PG_CONNECT	Cannot connect to PostgreSQL server
	20	ERROR_ARCHIVE_FAILED	Cannot archive WAL files
	21	ERROR_NO_BACKUP		Backup file not found
	22	ERROR_CORRUPTED		Backup file is broken
	23	ERROR_ALREADY_RUNNING	Cannot start because another pg_rman
					is running
	24	ERROR_PG_INCOMPATIBLE	Version conflicted with server
	25	ERROR_PG_RUNNING	Error due to server running
	26	ERROR_PID_BROKEN	postmaster.pid is broken
